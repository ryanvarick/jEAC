/**
 * GPFuncInfo is a Prototype wrapper object which holds a single GPNode
 * and is stored in arrays keyed by the GPNode's type.  The purpose of
 * GPFuncInfo is to provide a hook for future development to add "facts"
 * about GPNode prototypes as they're stored away waiting to be cloned
 * into trees, without having to modify GPNode itself, which would
 * be brittle since it's the superclass of all GP function nodes.

        hash contains arrays of GPFuncInfo objects of your class,
        keyed by a GPType (there's one array for every GPType there is).
        For example, you might sort elements in each array by some
        probability of occurrence, if you've subclassed GPFuncInfo to
        work with a GPNodeGenerator of some sort that requires this.
        This method only gets called on prototypes, though it might get
        called more than once, and with different values for hash. 
        Return the resultant hashtable (or if you've changed it to
        some other hashtable, return that). */
