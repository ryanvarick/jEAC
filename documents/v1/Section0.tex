\chapter{Introduction}
The Extended Analog Computer (EAC) is the instantiation of a theoretical model outlined by Lee Rubel.  Developed by Professor Jonathan Mills at Indiana University, it is used to explore Rubel's computational paradigm.  Project JEAC is an application front-end for the EAC.  The application will enable students and researchers to test analog configurations, collect feedback, and extract information from these machines.  The project's goal is develop a pedagogical interface that better supports the learning and explorational experiences that are crucial to attract research to the field of analog computing.
