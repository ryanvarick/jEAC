
CHANGELOG for jEAC:



04/26/2006 - v1.1.1

	* BUGFIX - USBDriver.java - modified reload() to reset the JEACNodes
	* JEAC.java - added status bar states to the configuration loader

04/26/2006 - v1.1.0

	* JEAC.java - statusbar now indicates reset state when connecting to a new device
	* NodeMap.java - added a reload() method to re-sync the UI and the JEACNodes
	* USBDriver.java - updated reload() to simply reset() and re-init the LLAs
		- JEACNodes are handled by JEAC.java (FileIOListener) and NodeMap.reload()
	* Gradient3D.java - added setLabel()
		- working on label support, maybe in a future version
	* TodoList.java - moved some issues to Sourceforge
	* removed 1.0.x releases



04/26/2006 - v1.0.5

	* BUGFIX: (1476459) - fixed regression in reconfigureWindow()
	* BUGFIX: (1477024) - fixed the orientation of the internal uEAC representation
	
	* forked v1.0 branch in source control



04/25/2006 - v1.0.4 - UI improvments, uEAC driver fixes

	* BUGFIX (1476439) - USBDriver.java - no feedback for allocating too many LLAs
	* BUGFIX (1476425) - USBDriver.java - LLAs are not properly de-allocated on type change
	* BUGFIX (1476501) - JEAC.java - load menu item is only active when a driver is connected
	* BUGFIX - JEAC.java - fixed cast error in reconfigureMenu()
	
	* REQ (1476434) - ControlFrame.java - added key accelerators
	* REQ (1476441) - JEAC.java - added reset() to NewDriverListener
	
	* USBDriver.java - reset timeout values to 1000ms
	* USBDriver.java - changed probe command to NOK_TEST -- it doesn't matter, but it makes sense for debugging
	* USBDriver.java - changed getVoltageGradient() to try-catch voltage conversion; on failure, a cached copy is returned
	* JEAC.java - reset update interval to 1s
	* JEAC.java - changed startInterfaceUpdateThread() to run immediately, then schedule the task
	* Gradient2D/3D.java - removed driver.getVoltageGradient(), instead initialized with a blank gradient
		- this was causing errors when toggling gradient views in heavy use situations



04/23/2006 - v1.0.3 - OSX uEAC fixes

	* USBDriver.java - delayed driver constructor call in getPortList until after blacklist checking
	* USBDriver.java - made blacklist checking case insensitve
	* USBDriver.java - blacklisted "bluetooth" and "cu" devices (OSX)



04/21/2006

	* USBDriver.java - moved debug control into a static method
	* USBDriver.java - removed "LON" on connect

04/20/2006 - v1.0.2 - uEAC LED support

	* USBDriver.java - added KNOWN_BAD list of ports to ignore, updated getPortList() to ignore ports
	* USBDriver.java - added toggleLEDs() and class-private ledsEnabled variable (LED toggling)
	* JEAC.java - updated to support LED toggles (uEAC only)
		- updated LEDListener, reconfigureMenu()

04/20/2006 - v1.0.1 - fixed uEAC LLAs, changed SRC/SNK slider behavior

	* ControlFrame.java - disabled slider snapping, it was causing SRC/SNK driver events to fire twice
		(first to write the user-selected value, then to write the slider-snapped value)
	* USBDriver.java - fixed a string comparison bug in changeNode() 
	* BUILD - updated BUILD notes for OSX, win32, added JRE notes
		


04/18/2006 - driver fixes

	* FIXED (bugs 1473306, 1473311, 1473313): LLA Inspector breaks on LLA change
		- HAL: getNumActiveLLAs -> getNumLLAs (USBDriver now generates a fixed list of MAX_LLAS)
		- USBDriver: folded changeNodeValue into changeNode
		- USBDriver: new changeNode logic
			- fixes bug that prevented LLAs from being initialized to function 1
		- USBDriver: rolled reset logic into resetNode (no longer dependent on changeNodeValue)
