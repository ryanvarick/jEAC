# jEAC
An integrated EAC development environment.

## Overview
I built this application as part of my Master's thesis at Indiana University. It is a graphical user interface intended to help students how to use extended analog computers (EAC). jEAC is the successor to a [command-line program](https://github.com/ryanvarick/eac-toolkit) that served the same purpose. I put these repositories on Github so that I could retire my own Subversion servers. 

Both jEAC and the EAC Toolkit require specialized hardware (either a network-accessible EAC or a USB uEAC) to do anything useful.

## Brief History
As an undergraduate, I was interested in analog computation. I built the original EAC Toolkit to provide better tools for interacting with the hardware we had in our labs. Later, I added a genetic algorithm implementation to help with "programming" the EACs. 

In graduate school, I wanted to help students learn how to use the EAC. The command-line EAC Toolkit was too confusing for novices, so I built the GUI-based jEAC. jEAC made it much easier to visual how the EAC voltage gradient changed in response to external input. The 1.x branches reflect this work. 

After I graduated, I continued to work on jEAC for a few months. I was in the midst of completely revamping the UI to be more like and IDE when I moved away and started my career as a designer. The 2.0 branch reflects this work.

## tl;dr

Bottom line: This was a research project written a long time ago for specialized hardware. I would be surprised if it even compiles anymore, much less does anything useful.
